                            <p> <span>W</span>hen I was a kid, I used to live with my grandmother only because both of my parents were OFWs; eventually, my mother retired and decided to stay with me wanting to see me blossom into a fine woman. Then 2nd grade, for the first time, I have met my long lost older half-brother, in which the funny thing here is that he was completely clueless about my existence. But, being the ever jolly person I was, never did I let him feel excluded. Moving on to elementary, I didn't have any constant group of friends as everyone saw me as their number one rival in terms of academics. It was because from kinder to grade 5, I would always be recognized as the class' top 1, to which I graduated as the class valedictorian in 6th grade. But my efforts were not intended for people's acknowledgement of my attainments, rather all were dedicated to only my family and of course, myself. Yet, I can't truly say that the treatment I received from my classmates didn't affect me when in fact it was one of the reasons why I suffered from depression and transformed into someone I barely know; the memories alone haunts me up to this day. Breaking free from that toxic environment didn't made much of a change because the fear was still within me. At the beginning of my high school journey, I barely socialize nor try to fit in because I was scared that history might repeat itself and I’d got stuck again, not knowing how to move forward. But maybe God heard how I whimper at night, suppressing all the emotions I try to keep inside, hence He decided to surround me with people who I never though would make me feel so safe and secured - finally, I was home. There, I learned how to cut ties with people and disassociate myself from any form of toxicity. Thereupon, I became a wiser version of myself. At 13 years old, I started earning my own money from being a part-time modeling trainer, model of a local clothing brand, and character preference for a comic project; whereas now, my current sideline is being a brand ambassadress of a milktea shop. Perhaps, the pain shaped me in who I am today and I'm thankful for that. <br>

So much had happened in merely a span of 6 years, and I'd say the old Gwynn's nowhere to be found now, whereupon I find it both necessary and disappointing. I have always been committed to academic perfection because of the satisfaction I feel whenever I'd see my name on top, yet despite that, my social life has never been dull nor lifeless - it was always full of dramas! Well, I most certainly am not the bookworm type of student but I value scholastic achievements so much, to the point that people often mistake me as a person who's far too focused on acquiring high test scores and recitation points. At first, studying was merely my escape from this harsh reality for I truly found it therapeutic; yet over time, a realization dawned me - learning was no longer a diversion, rather, a scheme for my end goal. Perhaps, it was my curiosity and hunger for new knowledge that have driven me to take on and enjoy this difficulth path as a high honor student. The titles I received from all the efforts and time I invested surprisingly became an assurance that I have an exceptional potential of embracing a bright future ahead of me; the stability in life. Being educated enough allows us to become independent in almost every aspect of life, thus unlocking a whole word of opportunities, much more, career options. This is because knowledge makes us confident with our capabilities and consequently, people take us more seriously as we conform to society's standards. Apart from achieving financial security through education, likewise, it is a fundamental instrument for growth, development, and maturity. We look at things holistically, think rationally, and decide wisely when approaching various situations. As you can see, educational status is not limited to only the number of one's accomplishments, because even with all those medals and titles, we are just the same. </p>

                <p class="services__description">For the young, pure, innocent me, being surrounded by people who have selfish intentions didn't bothered her; well, at least that's what I thought. Graduation day, seeing every single one in the class cry except me, made me realize that I was never really happy with them, perhaps I just needed someone to fill the "friendship" space in my heart. I was well-aware that most of them were backstabbing me, and if you'd ask whether or not confronting them ever crossed my mind, you bet it did, but the fear of getting waken up from my sugar-coated truth was the main reason why I just couldn't bring myself into doing it. And so, graduation became the first-step of my plan to cut ties with them, bury the past, and start anew. Blessed enough, I did succeed in finding a sanctuary that made me want to live once again - my friends. I learned how to open up again because their presence alone was comforting. All of them were out-going probably why they were so easy to approach and be close with. Now, I'm more than glad to share that the connection or love between all of us, is what makes me want to live.</p>

                <h3 class="services__title">Family</h3>
                <p class="services__description">As a kid, I'd usually daydream of who I want to become when I grow up. Unlike those of my age who'd answer future professions, mine was always to be a mother exactly like mine’s and maybe, marry someone akin to my dad. Whenever I'm asked about my family narrative, I think of courage, love, compassion, and security. Never once throughout my childhood did I feel smothered nor drowned by their care. Up until now, even if my mom's the oh-so-strict type, both my parents treat me as their princess. I'd always receive full support from everything that I love to do, may it be with that of academics or my passions. As for my kuya Angelo, we're close but there's still this certain gap between us, which I think will never disappear because of the time fate stolen from us. We're still in the process of adjusting especially because we only know each other at a certain level, and beyond that seems to be a blur. Our family have been through worst and still, we continously choose to face battles and grow together. No family will ever be perfect but at least, God gave me a warm and loving one. </p>

                <h3 class="services__title">Romantic Relationship</h3>
                <p class="services__description">Though my mom's strict, she allows me to get involved in romantic relationships as long as I know my limitations. My first realization of love was both liberating and binding at once, like there's this connection between you two that is beyond words or any logical explanation. Everything was new to me; the butterflies, the warmth, even the pain afterwards. I was all-out draining myself for the sake of that certain person, until it just so happened that the colors were no longer there. Yes, love always comes with pain but I didn't thought it could shatter one's soul. Things fell apart but to my surprise, I felt free, as if I've been holding my breath for so long. Perhaps, love faded and the only thing we were both holding onto was our memories. It was suffocating to be in a relationship with someone who's unsure of me for it triggers the insecurities within. Hence, I diverted all my attention to my studies and practiced self-care, guarding my heart from any luring promise. Now, here I am falling in love with the stillness and calmness of my heart, for I finally learned how to sail in this wavy ocean of love.</p>
